The Student Admission Management System is a software application designed to efficiently manage student admissions using Linked Lists.
It processes student records, calculates admission marks based on Tawjihi grades and Placement Test scores, and assigns students to their respective majors according to predefined criteria. The system supports file management, student and major data handling,
admission mark computation, alternative major suggestions, and statistical reporting. A graphical user interface (GUI) enhances usability, making the admission process more organized and efficient.
